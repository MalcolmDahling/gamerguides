----- HEADER -----
Searchbar in header doesn't close when clicked again.


----- CAROUSEL -----
Game description disappears between 620-600px width.
Links don't really fit at very small screen sizes. Fixed with flexWrap:'wrap'.


----- MAIN TOP MENU -----
Margin between "Now available" an "Coming soon" is not the same as the left side padding on smaller resolutions.
Up/down buttons are not centered.


----- GAME SORTING -----
Sorting by publisher is wrong, probably reversed.
