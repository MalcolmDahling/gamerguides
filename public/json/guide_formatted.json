Meanwhile, the more common ranged weapon you find on zealots is the Braced Autoguns. These weapons are great for spraying into hordes, mowing things down, and even dealing lots of damage to specialists. The only downside is they lose their accuracy at range, which is fine. You’ll often find Braced Autoguns are the go-to ranged weapon for Zealots thanks to their practicality, and when their cheat death is on cooldown, they need to avoid taking melee damage."

Its primary attack is similar to other ranged staffs as it projects a ranged attack capable of hitting far-away enemies. Meanwhile, the Purgatus is a flame thrower that scales with Soulblaze feats, especially the level 30 feat. Moreso, it is effortlessly staggers Specialists and hordes alike with fully charged heavy attacks repeatedly. When it stacks, it can melt specialists very easily too, no matter their armor type.

This means you must throw your grenade high enough to land just above an enemy horde’s head. Grenades explode around five seconds after throwing them. If you’re on an elevated position, you will need higher, so the grenade counts down while on a higher throw and shorter range. If hordes are around 60 meters away, you must throw roughly 40-degree height."

This is one of the more open sky areas of any of the levels in the game, especially in the early levels.

We managed to get it by standing at the back of the road that leads to the giant gothic temple building at the top of the road. We stood far back from the stairs, aimed around 35 degrees in the air, roughly where the arches are, and then throw.

You have to successfully use the skill in combat for the counter to increment, but the quality of your opponent or the efficacy of the attack doesn’t matter. As long as you hit, you should get credit. Enemies are somewhat finite near the beginning of the game, but you’ll eventually unlock areas that allow you to fight to your heart’s content.

Fortunately being up on this ledge should suffice if you aim properly, but you can also ricochet the Leviathan Axe off a twilight stone on the wall opposite the Loot Lizard if you’d prefer a more sure-fire solution."

For Light Runic Attacks, the Leviathan Axe’s Njord’s Tempest usually results in knocking enemies back far enough for them to land in the pits, and Hel’s Touch has the potential to do the same. For the Blades of Chaos, Flames of Anguish will reliably knock enemies back, as will Cyclone of Chaos.

Another slightly less precise option is the Finger of Ruin attack for the Draupnir Spear, which summons a large tornado that casts enemies in all directions. You can’t be certain that enemies will be cast into the pits using this one, but it’s worth a try since it has the potential to throw multiple enemies into the lava pits at the same time, with very little effort required in terms of following up with regular attacks."

The push back effect here is incredibly useful, as it can instantly cast multiple enemies into a lava pit with one use. However, you need to be careful to use this at the correct time, since the effect has a relatively short reach, so you can only use it when multiple enemies are close to you within melee range, and when their backs are turned to a lava pit.

This will allow you to grapple onto the enemy and pull them towards you, either killing them instantly if you inflict enough damage, or drawing them into the lava pit below.

Hel’s Touch is a good example, since it can be executed quickly and it has the ability to knock back all nearby enemies. Njord’s Tempest is another good one which can hit multiple enemies quickly, and there are riskier picks such as Breath of Thamur which inflicts damage over a massive area, but you can’t interrupt the animation once it has started, so you could become locked in at a critical time if you’re not careful."

The Wulvers are perhaps the toughest to deal with in this selection, especially on the higher difficulties where they have quite a lot of health and they can inflict some serious damage with their relentless melee combos. You should aim to reserve your Light and Heavy Runic Attacks for when the Wulvers arrive, and try to kill them as quickly as possible with AoE (Area of Effect) attacks."

The Light Elves and Dark Elves could potentially cause you more trouble, since they’re a lot more evasive and they have special skills which can protect them from damage. The Light Elves have the ability to raise a shield, indicated by blue circle indicators, which you can only break through using your shield skill, by double tapping . Alternatively, you can try using a sufficiently powerful Runic Attack or Relic / Sword Hilt ability to break through their shield, but this can be a waste since the shield ability is so simple and easy to perform."

The trusty Njord’s Tempest for the Leviathan Axe is executed more swiftly, and generally inflicts more damage, so focus on attacks which fit this description where possible.

Finally, you’ll encounter some Wisps at points throughout the fight, and the main thing to consider here is that you should prioritize killing them, and keep them away from each other. If three Wisps are within melee distance of each other, they will begin to form into a Wight, which is a much tougher enemy to deal with.

On the other hand, if you have more of a defensive build you can just as easily focus on staying alive for as long as possible, while killing off weaker enemies which will add to the total kill count towards 22, and will reset the timer back to 30 seconds each time you kill one, ensuring that you don’t run out of time. So long as you’re confident with blocking, parrying, and / or dodging multiple enemies at once, you can easily finish this trial without much trouble even if you leave the elite enemies (Wulvers and Wights) alone."

This boss is quite swift and evasive, capable of stepping back away from melee range in a split second, which can cause you to miss landing Runic Attacks if you’re not careful.

You can do this by using Light or Heavy Runic Attacks to interrupt their combo, but waiting out the attack with a well timed series of blocks or one precise parry works too, before retaliating with a combo of your own. The main concern you should have about the Light Elves is for their casters: these will cast orbs of light which float towards you can explode upon contact.

You can then stun grab the Ogre and jump on its back, using it to smash through other enemies below while you remain invulnerable to damage for the entire duration that you’re on its back. Once you’re back down on the ground, you should be able to finish the Ogre off with a few regular attacks."

Atreus’ Wrath of the Wolf Runic Summon is great for this fight as they’ll cause her to flinch for the duration that they’re out which leaves ample time for you to lay down some of your own attacks. As mentioned above, the best time to attack Hjalti is after her blue-ring attack, the yellow-ring Lunging Backhand attack, and the red-ring Double Hand Slam attack. After each of these attacks, you can get a few hits on her, and when combined with the sonic arrows, build up the stun bar a fair bit."

The hardest attack to deal with has to be either her boomerang or her Quadstrike. The boomerang has weird timing, and although rolling backwards, and to the side appears to make it miss more often, you may still get hit by it. When that happens, she’ll follow it up with a lunge, or if later on in the battle, another boomerang, and then a lunge. With the Quadstrike, it can be hard to judge the parry timings as she’ll perform the first yellow-ring attack, then briefly stop, before doing the second yellow-ring attack. After that the next two normal attacks come quickly, and then she’ll slow down the red-ring attack at the end.

This is the time to take it slow, and only attack when you have an opening. Do fewer attacks on her after you make her flinch, and wait for the next attack before committing. This is a good time to remember your companion exists, and use their attacks to take her down. When her health is depleted, run over to her and press  to finish the fight.

Fraekni will often follow this attack up with a few more melee strikes, so don’t let your guard down until you’re familiar with exactly how many strikes she tends to use.

Make sure you choose, and use your Rage (Fury or Valor) to keep your health above 50%, so you can at least take a hit or two should you make a mistake. Gna will really punish you if you get hit by an attack as another attack is always around the corner, and one of her combos can end a perfect run in seconds.

The problem is, a lot of the animations for specific attacks are similar, and she can change it mid-combo from a blockable attack to an unblockable attack."

Not much, unfortunately, but she does appear to be susceptible to sonic damage, and you can make her flinch a lot with your Relic, and Runic attacks. Freya’s  Steel Harmony attack is also a nice way to interrupt Gna. Another weakness she has is she will leave herself open after a lot of her attacks, and you should be able to get at least a combo of your own on her, but this lessens when her health gets low."

This allows you to continue juggling them in the air, making it a good starting Runic Attack for the Blades. Flames of Anguish is great for inflicting the Burn status, especially once it is fully upgraded. It does have a fairly long COOLDOWN of 93 seconds, although you can lower this by increasing your own COOLDOWN stat. Also, as with any Runic Attacks, increasing your RUNIC stat will cause it to deal more damage."
